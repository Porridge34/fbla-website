			<p><h1>Our Mission</h1></p>
            <p>CSimplified seeks to make cybersecurity simple and accessible-- to give people access to cybersecurity without compromise. We believe that people shouldn’t need any knowledge about cybersecurity in order to feel that their data is secure-- after all, that’s our job-- but should be afforded the transparency of understanding what is happening behind the curtain as they exist online.</p>
            <br/>
            <p>CSimplified’s vision is to make people more aware of a changing online world, educate those who rely on it, and ensure the safety and protection of those who exist in it.</p>
