			<p><h2>What is CSimplified?</h2></p>
            <p>The internet is a huge part of our lives. Our friends and family can be reached by the push of a button, our bank accounts are a password away, and all the answers we could ask for are at our fingertips. You shouldn’t have to be an IT expert to use this resource without worry. Online safety shouldn’t be a hassle. That’s why we make protecting your information CSimplified. </p>

			<p><h2>What does CSimplified do?</h2></p>
            <p>CSimplified takes the stress out of security. Our add-on disables trackers, ads, and popups for a faster, more effective, and safer browsing experience. We work to educate our customers by encouraging strong and unique passwords, ensuring they are aware of two-factor authentication, and warning users of insecure websites, networks, and untrustworthy links. The internet can be confusing, especially knowing what to trust: a single character can mean the difference between a safe search and a hacked device. With CSimplified, you don’t have to worry. We offer cybersecurity without compromise. </p>
