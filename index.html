			<p><h1>Cybersecurity Made Simple</h1></p>
			<img src = 'images/homepage.jpg' alt = 'placeholder' width="400">
			<p>CSimplified is a company aimed at making cybersecurity simpler-- everyone should have access to cybersecurity without compromise. We believe that everyone should be able to have a safe presence online, regardless of their exposure to computer science.  Young people and the elderly especially tend to have a lack of exposure to online security and an add-on which keeps their data secure online while targeting their needs specifically, thereby allowing them to navigate the internet safely with ease. </p>
